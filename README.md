The Micro11 Control Panel is a script to enable/disable some hidden windows features.

It is not finished and some features may not work as intended, so be careful.

More features will be added in the future so keep you eyes on the github page or the website.

The "Micro11 Debloater" Option on the program will run code that completely debloats windows 11 and optimises it for speed and gaming.

What is removed in the Micro11 Debloater: Clipchamp, News, Weather, Xbox, GetHelp, GetStarted, Office Hub, Solitaire, eopleApp, PowerAutomate, ToDo, Alarms, Mail and Calendar, Feedback Hub, Maps, Sound Recorder, Your Phone, Media Player, QuickAssist, Internet Explorer, LA57 support, OCR for en-us, Speech support, TTS for en-us, Media Player Legacy, Tablet PC Math, Wallpapers, Edge (FINALLY) , OneDrive.

The script may be unstable and can cause problems if used incorrectly, so use with caution and only use if you know what you are doing.

The script is in early development and some things may not function as intended.

I can promise you that there are no viruses in the script whatsoever, for those wondering.

Please report any issues on the github in the issues tab.
