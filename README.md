The Micro11 Control Panel is a file to enable/disable some hidden windows features.

It is not finished and some features may not work as intended, so be careful.

More features will be added in the future so keep you eyes on the github page or the website.

The "Micro11 Debloater" Option on the program will run code that completely debloats windows 11 and optimises it for speed and gaming.

The script may be unstable and can cause problems if used incorrectly, so use with caution and only use if you know what you are doing.

I can promise you that there are no viruses in the script whatsoever, for those wondering.

Please report any issues on the github in the issues tab.
